This script calculates the velocity of an internal combustion engine's piston(s) during it's cycle.

The output of this script can be useful for:
* Analyzing the affect of stroke, rod ratio, and max rpm on peak piston velocity and angle
* Engine Management Tuning
* Comparing different engines geometries
* Making informed decisions about operating RPM as related to longevity
* Arguing with people on car forums


Input Example:

Output Example Visualized as Graph:

Future development:
* Outputing peak velocity and angle to console
* Piston acceleration
* GUI with graphing output could be cool
